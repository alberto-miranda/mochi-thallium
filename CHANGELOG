* Added copy() function in serialization archives. This function
  acts like a read() for input archive, and like a write() for
  output archives. This allows writing a single serialize() function
  instead of load()/store() functions in many situations.
* Added operator() to input and output archives to enable a syntax
  similar to that of the cereal library.
